# Introduction into writing a thesis

Writing a thesis is hard. Here are some tips. They may sound complicated in the beginning and probably cost you 1-2 hours of initial investment, but this will payoff very quickly. The advantage is that a tool is doing all the cumbersome formatting for you and you can concentrate on writing your content.

1. Use the editor *VS Code* instead of a word processor such as _Word_. An editor helps you to create text without formatting. Also changing your text is much easier if you do not have to respect formatting. Only format your text at the end just shortly before you submit your thesis.

2. Write your thesis in *Markdown*. Markdown is like writing text, however, with some formatting agreements. You can always transform your markdown into _Word_ or _PDF_ without any hassle if you do not like Markdown.

In the next chapter you will find some tips and tricks and the necessary tools that will make your life easier. Enjoy.
